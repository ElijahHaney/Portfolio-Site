Task worked on: <br><br>
This week the main thing that I worked on was learning to use functions in java script. I learned what functions are, a few rules about functions and what they can be used for. This was more of a refresher as I know how to write java script code, but I have not done so in a long time. The specific things that I did was that I first read about all of the rules of using functions in Java Script. So I learned about how  if x=5 and you write (++x) the output will be 6. This is a shorter way to write y= x+1. Alongside this, I also learned other shortcuts and ways to write the same thing more efficiently. After learning the rules I had to put a few lines of code onto the website that I was working on. At first it did not work and I spent about 30 minutes trying to resolve the issue, but after searching I found out that I had one small spelling error in one of the lines. So I just resolved the issue and It worked smoothly from there.<br><br>

The most interesting I learned in the daily ticket this week was that GIF's are being replaced with MP4 files. This was a little bit of a shock to me as the MP4 format is not as good as the GIF format is at its job. For example GIF's have a seamless transition in the looping of the images, while MP4's are a bit clunkier and usually have a short pause before it transitions. Despite this fact the GIF's are still slowly being replaced because of how old the technology they use is. For example the file size is really large causing you to have to greatly lower the resolution to lower the file size. For this reason they are being replaced by a bit of a more efficient file format in the form of an MP4. <br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
﻿The main things that I learned and worked on this week was getting the company for my website worked on and figured out. I also got my navigation bar to where I want it to be, but not for the dropdown bar as it is not wanting to work for me. For Friday graphics this week I worked on making geometrical graphics and shapes. We made a square repeat and turn into a sort of wreath and we made a tree repeat inside of itself with a gradient for the stroke. <br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is the transform tool, used to make cool effects on shapes. You can use it bot to make a shape rotate as an effect and to make a shape repeat inside itself. This is really nice as you are able to make cool effects that you can use for different applications.<br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
I worked mainly on finishing up my logo and trying to get images that are not copyrighted. The first part of finding an image that I could use was to go onto unsplash and search for the image. After I found a few images that were the approximate size that I wanted, I chose the one that best fit my theme and calm colors. I then tried to use illustrator to add my logo onto the front of the building. I also tried to start to fill in some of the information into my website. I learned a bit about how illustrator works, as I had to try to make my logo match the colors and the lighting of the image.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is how borders react when you merge an image in illustrator. Using this method will allow you to make a really interesting image. I made my logo using this method which I stumbled upon completely by accident.<br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
I have learned about how to efficiently communicate while writing. This includes techniques from how you send the message, to the tone in the message. This is very useful as everyone is going to have to send an email some time in their life. I also learned a little about how to fix navigation bars. I learned that one of the main issues that I was having is that my one <.div.> in my navbar had padding on all sides causing it to have a gap on the top when I only needed a gap on the sides and bottom. To fix this I Changed it so that all of the sides had a different ammount of padding.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is the written communication PDP. This was interesting as it helped me learn and develop some good strategies and rules when it comes to communicating effectively. This was the best PDP so far as most of the previous ones I already knew almost everything, while this one had a few new concepts for me to learn.<br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
This week I worked on my illustrator pen tool skills. I did this by making a Friday Graffix project that was centered around the pathfinder and the pen tool. I learned that it is easier to mass produce different natural shapes for example the pattern in wood by drawing one or two different shapes with the pen tool and then copying it and warping it with the warp tool. I also worked on copying my template for my navbar and format of my website to all pages.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is the warp tool. Before learning about the warp tool I made everything that was slightly different by hand to make it all look unique, but now it is really easy to mass produce different types of natural patterns. It is one of my favorite tools in illustrator.<br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
I have learned how to use photoshop, gotten better at quickly making designs in illustrator and I have gotten a little work done on my website. I have learned about the different functions on photoshop and when to use a specific tool. So if you are trying to select a square you can use the square selection tool but if you are trying to select a person you should instead use the lasso tool. In illustrator I worked on trying to go from a picture or reference to a product as fast as possible. To do this I first thought about what techniques I could use to make it go as fast as possible. So should I use the pen tool or should I merge shapes and other questions like that to speed up the design process. I also started to fill in some of the information on my website. I started to get some of the contact information, and site information filled out.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing was photoshop. I have some experience using photoshop, but I have never done something where I need to put soup in some ones hand so it was quite interesting. It was also a good refresher as I have not used photoshop in a long time.<br><br>

Task worked on:<br><br>
I worked on getting better at using Photoshop by making two of my daily projects be photoshop projects. What I did first was a project where I replaced the background and made somebody hold something. To do this I used the lasso tool as well as using the background eraser tool. I also got some work done on my website for the media competition. I worked on trying to resolve some issues I had with the code and I got some more of the information filled out on it. To do this I had to run my code through a validator and then resolve the issues. I only had a few issues and they where not that bad to fix.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is Photoshops background eraser. it allows you to erase a part of the background without damaging the person/ thing that you want to keep. As long as there is some sort of contrast between the object and background you can trace the outside of the object and delete the background only. This is useful and saves a lot of time as if you where to try and use the regular eraser or even the lasso tool it would take a little longer than using the background eraser.<br><br>

I added 2 pages to my website and I have started to fill out the information on the sites. I have filled out the welcome page and I have started to work on the menu page. In illustrator I have worked on my ability to make something look really similar to a reference image. I trained on this skill by making my letters for the logo as close to the original as possible.<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is the pen tool in illustrator. This is the interesting thing as the pen tool is among the most versatile tools in illustrator. It can make literally anything. This could be things like a crown to a specific font that you want to make.<br><br>

This weeks interesting thing is the spot healing tool. It is so useful as you can fix any small details or blemishes on the image in an instant. For example if you are trying to get rid of acne on some ones face you can just use the spot heal and it will cover it up almost seamlessly.

<br><br>
What is your This Week's Interesting Thing for this week?<br><br>
This weeks interesting thing is the crop tool and its AI. The Crop tool is probably one of if not the most important tool in photoshop. The tool is not only useful when you want to cut off a part of the image but also when you need to center or rotate an image. The AI in photoshop can also be used to keep all of the things on the picture and add an AI generated extra part to the picture. This tool is o useful as you can make a good picture that is a little crooked into a perfect picture that is straight.
