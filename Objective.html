What is a good Video Game? What is the best design style? What are some good practices? How should I design a game? All of these are questions that YOU need to answer yourself. Because when it comes to video games there are so many different genres and styles of game that there is no definitive answer to these questions. So what I believe is the best way to develop a game, and what I think is the best style and genre of game is different from what you may think. That is also one of the strengths of this field. You can use your creativity to make something that is completely different and unique when compared to everyone else.<br><br>

	If I had to answer the questions though I would definitely say that a good video game is a game that is well developed, that is frequently updated, and that is unique. The worst thing to me is when you are playing a game that you love and out of nowhere they stop updating the game. If a game is poorly developed and has a lot of glitches or if the game is a literal clone of another game you can just not play the game, but if you LOVE a game and they just stop all development it kinda sucks as you see how the game could have been so good.<br><br>

	For the second question I would say that the best design style is your design style. This may seem like a safe answer so that nobody gets mad at me for saying that their design style is worse, but I really think that your design style is the best. This is because no matter how hard you try, if you are trying to design something that does not look the way that you are good at designing, or the way you prefer to design it is not going to be as good looking or as fun for you to design. This could lead to you losing interest and motivation in continuing the game. So you should just try to design it the way you want and stick to your style.<br><br>

	Now what are some good practices? Well in my opinion the most important practice is telling the player a story. Having a deep story or some sort of storyline in the game is the most effective way of making an intriguing game. It is important as it adds depth to the game and it makes people want to see what is going to happen next to their character. Another important practice is adding variety throughout the game. This could mean offering new skills and weapons throughout the game, or even letting them switch characters/ people entirely. The larger/ longer the game is the more important this is, as using the same weapon for 2-5 hours is fine, but using the same weapon for say 20 hours gets very boring.<br><br>

	And for the final question, how should I design a game? This differs depending on the type of game you are making. There are currently a lot of engines that you could make your game on, or you could even make a game from scratch, but either way you should write down your needs for the game. If you are going to need fancy graphics and a large map you should use an engine like Unreal Engine, and if you are making a small indie game you will not need to use a large engine like that. This does not mean that you can not do so, but it will in the end add a lot of unnecessary time to the design process.<br><br>

	No matter what you are wanting to make, whether it be a small indie mobile game or a large PC game like Elden Ring you are going to have to list down your desires. This includes design style, graphics quality, and many other factors that pay a role in the design process. You can then decide where and how to design the game. And just remember, creativity is crucial so don't be afraid to make a unique game.<br><br>
